## The data representing the DialogGraph node that we are currently handling.

## Go to the next node in the graph.
## Optionally accepts the port that should be used for naviation.
## If no port is provided, the last connection is always used.
## Returns false if there is no node to navigate to.
## Returns true if we hae navigated to the next node.
